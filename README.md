# deep-learning-challenge

## Objective: 
Develop a deep learning-based predictive model to assess the likelihood of organizational success, utilizing features that describe various organizations. The goal is to create a classifier that predicts an organization's success based on its characteristics.

## Results and Data Preparation:

The primary metric for prediction is "IS_SUCCESSFUL."
The model includes all columns except the "EIN," which was excluded from the dataset.
Overall Performance: The model attained approximately 78% accuracy on the test dataset, with a loss value of 0.45.
Additional Recommendation: Exploring a Random Forest model is advisable, as it could provide alternative insights and solutions for this classification challenge.
