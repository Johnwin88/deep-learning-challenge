## Overview: 
This project focuses on employing deep learning methods to develop a predictive model aimed at assessing the 
success potential of various organizations. The dataset contains a range of attributes pertaining to different 
organizations. The primary objective is to create a classifier that can accurately predict an organization's 
success based on its specific features.

## Results:
Data Processing:
> The primary variable of interest for this model is labeled as "IS_SUCCESSFUL".
> The model incorporates all dataset features, excluding the "EIN" column, which was omitted.
> The "EIN" column was excluded from the feature set.

## Summary: 
The developed model demonstrated a test accuracy of approximately 78%, alongside a loss measure of 0.45. 
Considering the results, exploring a Random Forest model is advisable as it might present alternative insights 
for this classification challenge.
